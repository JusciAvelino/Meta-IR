# Meta-IR: Meta-Learning for Imbalanced Regression

## Introduction

Meta-Learning for Imbalanced Regression (Meta-IR) is a recommendation system designed to address imbalanced regression tasks. The goal of Meta-IR is to recommend suitable algorithms and techniques based on problem meta-features, which are used as input to the meta-classifier. The meta-classifier then suggests an optimal resampling strategy and learning algorithm, effectively creating a customized pipeline tailored to a new problem's meta-features.

## How Meta-IR Works

Meta-IR operates by analyzing the characteristics of a given dataset to determine the appropriate resampling strategy and learning algorithm.
